      <h2>I build human experiences.</h2>
      <p class="py-0 text-left writing">
      Somewhere along the way, <b>UX became sterile.</b> Touchpoints became "interfaces" and people became "users". Data was glorified at the expense of intuition (when in reality, data is only as accurate as its population size, which is never 100%). And science killed art. Everything became lopsided; everything became the same.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>My purpose is to change that.</b> For me, when it comes to the debate of whether design is a science or an art, it's not either/or but both/and. A little yin, a little yang.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; Study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” — Leonardo Da Vinci
      </blockquote>
      <p class="writing">
      That's why I <b>think beyond the interface.</b> Because really, the last thing people need is another app. But everyone could use a better experience⏤a human experience.

      <h2>6 reasons not to hire me:</h2>
      <h3 class="writing">I do more than my job requires.</h3>
      <p class="sub-list">
      Most companies want you to do what you're asked and no more. Going outside of your job description might threaten someone else's standing in the company. Yeah, I don't buy that.
      </p>
      <h3 class="writing">I didn't go to an Ivy League school.</h3>
      <p class="sub-list">
      I don't have a fancy-pants resume. I went to a state school. Hard work and passion define me.
    </p><h3 class="writing">I'm not going to work for your company forever. </h3>
      <p class="sub-list">
      There it is; I said it! You'll get 6 years out of me at best. 6 really good years. 6 years of insanely good work. See, I'm with Steve Jobs on this one: You don't get A teams by hiring B players. I've got dreams of my own, big ones, in fact. Those include starting businesses in tech, fashion, and food. Any great hire will move on eventually. But that's exactly why you should hire them⏤because they'll treat your company like their own.
      </p>
      <h3 class="writing">I don't believe in 9-5.</h3>
      <p class="sub-list">
      I know myself. I know when and how I am most productive. You're not going to get the best out of me by making me sit at a desk for 8 hours. I usually come up with my best ideas in nature, so breaks from work are important. That being said, I might work at 6 am, I might work at 11pm, and I might work on the weekend. In return, you'll get my best work. Of course, this is purely for <italic>creating</italic>. Managing is a totally different way of working, one that requires set hours and consistency.
      </p>
      <h3 class="writing">My family comes first.</h3>
      <p class="sub-list">
      Work is cool and all, but nothing beats the embrace of my wife, or the hug of my 3 year old son, or the giggle of my 9 month-old-daughter.
      </p>
      <h3 class="writing">I'm not a pushover.</h3>
      <p class="sub-list">
      Friction applied in the right direction sharpens the sword. Gone awry, it removes its edge alltogether. It requires balance and precision, but without friction, you'll never get an awesome product.
      </br>
      </br>
      Also, I don't contribute to groupthink.
